In this repository, you will learn the basics of quantum computing and some of the math behind it like linear algebra and probability in classical systems. Then, we will move on to basic quantum states with one and two qubits. After that, we will look at the basics of quantum circuits and learn gates to implement in our own quantum circuits. Lastly, we will finish off by learning some recent algorithms to do computational research using quantum computing.
